# INSTALL

*sshdo* - controls which commands may be executed via incoming ssh

To install sshdo:

    tar xzf sshdo-1.1.tar.gz
    cd sshdo-1.1
    ./configure
    make test # optional
    sudo make install

This installs (approximately, depending on the operating system):

    /usr/bin/sshdo
    /etc/sshdoers
    /etc/sshdoers.d/
    /etc/sshdo.banner
    /usr/share/man/man8/sshdo.8
    /usr/share/man/man5/sshdoers.5

To install to /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/share/man, and /etc:

    sudo make PREFIX=/usr/local install

To install to /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/share/man, and /usr/local/etc:

    sudo make PREFIX=/usr/local ETCDIR=/usr/local/etc install

But note that the -C or --config option will need to be used when the config
file is not in the default directory set by the configure script (unless sshdo
is modified to change the default location). This isn't necessary if the
configure script is used to override paths. For more details, see:

    ./configure --help

To uninstall sshdo:

    sudo make uninstall
