# INSTALL

*sshdo* - controls which commands may be executed via incoming ssh

To install sshdo:

    tar xzf sshdo-1.0.tar.gz
    cd sshdo-1.0
    make check
    sudo make install

This installs:

    /usr/bin/sshdo
    /etc/sshdoers
    /etc/sshdoers.d/
    /etc/sshdo.banner
    /usr/share/man/man8/sshdo.8.gz
    /usr/share/man/man5/sshdoers.5.gz

To install to /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/share/man, and /etc:

    sudo make PREFIX=/usr/local install

To install to /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/share/man, and /usr/local/etc:

    sudo make DESTDIR=/usr/local PREFIX=/usr/local/bin install

But note that the -C or --config option will need to be used when the config
file is not in /etc (unless sshdo is patched to change the default location).

To uninstall sshdo:

    sudo make uninstall

# REQUIREMENTS

Requires Python 2.6+ or Python 3, Perl's pod2man (for the manual pages),
