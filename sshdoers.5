.SH "NAME"
"/etc/sshdoers" \- configuration file for sshdo(8)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers\*(C'\fR file configures \fI\f(BIsshdo\fI\|(8)\fR and specifies the commands
that are allowed to be executed via incoming \fI\f(BIssh\fI\|(1)\fR connections by users
whose authorized keys force the use of the \fIsshdo\fR command. The files in
the \f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers.d/\*(C'\fR directory specify additional allowed commands. Any
file in that directory whose name starts with a dot character (\f(CW"."\fR) is
ignored.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.IX Header "FILE FORMAT"
The following sections describe the different types of line that make up the
configuration files. There are comment lines and \fIauthorization\fR,
\&\fItraining\fR, \fImatch\fR, \fIsyslog\fR, \fIlogfiles\fR and \fIbanner\fR directives. Any
leading or trailing whitespace characters (e.g. \f(CW" "\fR) are ignored.
.SS "Comment"
.IX Subsection "Comment"
Comment lines start with optional whitespace and a hash character (\f(CW"#"\fR).
Comment lines and blank lines are ignored. Note that comments can't appear
after any non-whitespace character because hash characters have special
meaning in \fIauthorization\fR directives (see the next section).
.SS "Authorization"
.IX Subsection "Authorization"
\&\fIAuthorization\fR directives specify which users and groups are allowed to
execute which commands. They consist of one or more user names and/or group
names, separated by whitespace, followed by optional whitespace, a colon
character (\f(CW":"\fR), more optional whitespace, and a shell command.
.PP
Group names are preceded by a plus sign (\f(CW"+"\fR). A user name can be
preceded by a minus sign (\f(CW"\-"\fR) to indicate that the user is not allowed
to execute the command. These can be used together to allow most but not all
members of a group to execute a command.
.PP
A user name or group name can be followed by a forward slash character
(\f(CW"/"\fR) and a label that identifies which of the user's authorized keys to
allow. The label comes from \fIsshdo\fR's command line argument(s), if any, in
the \f(CW\*(C`command=""\*(C'\fR option in \f(CW\*(C`~/.ssh/authorized_keys\*(C'\fR files (or in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`ForceCommand\*(C'\fR directives in \f(CW\*(C`/etc/ssh/sshd_config\*(C'\fR). The label will
usually be something that identifies the remote owner of the authorized key.
Each authorized key in a \f(CW\*(C`~/.ssh/authorized_keys\*(C'\fR file would usually have a
different label but this isn't required. If multiple keys in a user's
\&\f(CW\*(C`~/.ssh/authorized_keys\*(C'\fR file use the same label, or no label, then they
will just be indistinguishable to \fIsshdo\fR and they will all share the same
\&\fIauthorization\fR directives. Labels might not be too useful when used with
group names rather than user names but they are supported just in case.
.PP
When user names or group names have no label, the \fIauthorization\fR directive
applies to all of their authorized keys. It is recommended to consider using
labels either for every key that uses \fIsshdo\fR in a
\&\f(CW\*(C`~/.ssh/authorized_keys\*(C'\fR file or for none of them. If some keys have a
label and others don't, then any \fIauthorization\fR directives that are
intended for the key(s) with no label will also apply to any key(s) with a
label. That might be desirable, depending on your requirements, but it might
not be.
.PP
The syntax of \fIauthorization\fR directives is:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  AUTHORIZATION ::= ENTITY (" "+ ENTITY)* " "* ":" " "* COMMAND
\&  ENTITY ::= USER | "+" GROUP | "\-" USER
\&  USER ::= username ("/" LABEL)?
\&  GROUP ::= groupname ("/" LABEL)?
\&  LABEL ::= short label with no whitespace or colons
\&  COMMAND ::= shell command | "<interactive>" | BINARY
\&  BINARY ::= "<binary>" " "* encoded shell command
.Ve
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  user1 user2/label +group3 \-user3: cmd arg
.Ve
.PP
The above example states that \fIuser1\fR may execute the command, \f(CW\*(C`cmd arg\*(C'\fR,
for any authorized key. So may \fIuser2\fR, but only for the authorized key(s)
whose \f(CW\*(C`command=""\*(C'\fR option includes \f(CW"label"\fR as the command line argument
to \fIsshdo\fR (i.e. \f(CW\*(C`command="/usr/bin/sshdo label"\*(C'\fR). Members of \fIgroup3\fR
may also execute the command but \fIuser3\fR may not, even if \fIuser3\fR is a
member of \fIgroup3\fR.
.PP
Note that the shell command must specify the entire command. It is not just
a prefix. The command can contain shell meta-characters. However, in the
unlikely event that the command contains any leading or trailing whitespace
characters (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`ssh user@host \*(Aq cmd arg \*(Aq\*(C'\fR), they are removed and so do
not need to be included. All internal whitespace characters in the command
are left intact and so do need to be included.
.PP
There is no aliasing or macro substitution or line continuation. However,
there is very limited pattern matching to represent commands that vary only
in the digits that appear on the command line (e.g. sequence numbers or
date/time stamps). Any single hash character (\f(CW"#"\fR) that appears in the
shell command represents either a literal hash character or a string of one
or more digit characters. Any string of two or more hash characters
represents that exact same number of hash or digit characters. See the
\&\fIMatch\fR section below for more detail.
.PP
Also, in the unlikely event that the command contains any binary/unprintable
characters, it must be specially encoded. It must start with
\&\f(CW"<binary>"\fR followed by optional whitespace and the command with
all binary/unprintable characters represented using hexadecimal notation
(e.g. a newline character would be represented as \f(CW"\ex0a"\fR). Also, all
backslash characters (\f(CW"\e"\fR) in the command must be quoted with a preceding
backslash character. But when the command does not contain any
binary/unprintable characters, this encoding is not necessary.
.PP
If an incoming \fIssh\fR connection's requested command matches an
\&\fIauthorization\fR directive in the configuration, it will be executed by
passing it to the user's login shell as the argument to its \f(CW\*(C`\-c\*(C'\fR option
(e.g. \f(CW\*(C`sh \-c \*(Aqcmd arg\*(Aq\*(C'\fR). If an incoming \fIssh\fR connection has no requested
command, then an interactive login is being requested. This is represented
in the configuration and in log messages as \f(CW"<interactive>"\fR. If
allowed, the user's login shell will be executed as an interactive login
shell (i.e. the first character of \f(CW\*(C`argv[0]\*(C'\fR is the dash character
(\f(CW"\-"\fR), e.g. \f(CW\*(C`\-sh\*(C'\fR).
.SS "Training"
.IX Subsection "Training"
\&\fITraining\fR directives specify which users and groups are allowed to execute
as yet unknown commands for the purpose of training \fIsshdo\fR's
configuration. They consist of the word \f(CW"training"\fR optionally followed by
user names and/or group names, all separated by whitespace.
.PP
Group names are preceded by a plus sign (\f(CW"+"\fR). A user name can be
preceded by a minus sign (\f(CW"\-"\fR) to indicate that the user is not to be put
into training mode. These can be used together to put most but not all
members of a group into training mode.
.PP
A user name or group name can be followed by a forward slash character
(\f(CW"/"\fR) and a label that identifies which of the user's authorized keys to
put into training mode. See the \fIAuthorization\fR section above for details
on labels.
.PP
The syntax of \fItraining\fR directives is:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  TRAINING ::= "training" (" "+ ENTITY)*
\&  ENTITY ::= USER | "+" GROUP | "\-" USER
\&  USER ::= username ("/" LABEL)?
\&  GROUP ::= groupname ("/" LABEL)?
\&  LABEL ::= short label with no whitespace or colons
.Ve
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  training user1 user2/label +group3 \-user3
.Ve
.PP
The above example states that \fIuser1\fR is in training mode for any
authorized key. So is \fIuser2\fR, but only for the authorized key(s) whose
\&\f(CW\*(C`command=""\*(C'\fR option includes \f(CW"label"\fR as the command line argument to
\&\fIsshdo\fR (i.e. \f(CW\*(C`command="/usr/bin/sshdo label"\*(C'\fR). Members of \fIgroup3\fR are
also in training mode but \fIuser3\fR is not, even if \fIuser3\fR is a member of
\&\fIgroup3\fR.
.PP
If no user names or group names appear in a \fItraining\fR directive, then
training mode applies globally to all users and keys. This is only
recommended when first incorporating \fIsshdo\fR into your \fIssh\fR
infrastructure. Once \fIsshdo\fR policy is established, training mode should
only be turned on selectively when introducing new functionality for an
existing key or when adding a new key to a user's \f(CW\*(C`~/.ssh/authorized_keys\*(C'\fR
file (unless you manually configure its allowed commands).
.PP
In training mode, \fIsshdo\fR will allow the execution of any command,
including ones that aren't allowed in the configuration, but they will be
logged with \f(CW\*(C`type="training"\*(C'\fR rather than \f(CW\*(C`type="allowed"\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`type="disallowed"\*(C'\fR. Note, however, that a command will still be disallowed
and not executed for users who have been explicitly excluded from executing
it (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`"\-user: cmd arg\*(C'\fR").
.PP
This is useful for gathering the exact commands that are currently in use.
For example, it's not at all obvious in advance which commands \fI\f(BIscp\fI\|(1)\fR or
\&\fI\f(BIrsync\fI\|(1)\fR will require \fIssh\fR to execute. Training mode makes it possible
to learn which commands need to be added to \f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers.d/\*(C'\fR to keep a system functioning after \fIsshdo\fR is
incorporated into it to improve security. Of course, training mode should
not be left in place long-term.
.PP
Once training mode has been in place for long enough to capture all
necessary activity, \fIsshdo\fR can be invoked with the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-learn\*(C'\fR option to
output the configuration that needs to be added to \f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers.d/\*(C'\fR in order to allow the existing activity in future. Once
that has been done, training mode can be turned off. Any disallowed commands
encountered after that will not be executed.
.PP
Also note that \fIsshdo\fR can occasionally be invoked with the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-unlearn\*(C'\fR
option to identify any \fIauthorization\fR directives that have not been used
recently and so no longer seem to be needed. It will output a new candidate
configuration that will contain the \fIauthorization\fR directives that are
needed to continue to allow commands that are still in use but it will
comment out any current \fIauthorization\fR directives that no longer seem to
be needed. If correct, this new candidate configuration can be used to
replace the \fIauthorization\fR directives in the current configuration to
maintain strict least privilege.
.PP
Note that a global \fItraining\fR directive with no user names or group names
that applies to all users and keys may only appear in \f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers\*(C'\fR, not
in \f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers.d/*\*(C'\fR. However, selective \fItraining\fR directives that only
apply to the keys of particular users or groups may appear in either
location. But it might be a good idea to keep all \fItraining\fR directives in
\&\f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers\*(C'\fR anyway.
.SS "Match"
.IX Subsection "Match"
The \fImatch\fR directive specifies how hash characters (\f(CW"#"\fR) are to be
interpreted in shell commands in \fIauthorization\fR directives. It also
affects the patterns identified by \fIsshdo\fR's \f(CW\*(C`\-\-learn\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-\-unlearn\*(C'\fR
options. It consists of the word \f(CW"match"\fR followed by whitespace and one
of the following values: \f(CW"exact"\fR, \f(CW"digits"\fR or \f(CW"hexdigits"\fR. The
default value is \f(CW"digits"\fR. Note that the \fImatch\fR directive may only
appear in \f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers\*(C'\fR, not in \f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers.d/*\*(C'\fR. Also, there should
only be one \fImatch\fR directive. If there is more than one, the last one
takes effect.
.PP
The value \f(CW"exact"\fR causes hash characters to match literal hash characters
only. The value \f(CW"digits"\fR causes them to match literal hash characters or
decimal digit characters (\f(CW"0".."9"\fR). The value \f(CW"hexdigits"\fR causes them
to match literal hash characters or hexadecimal digit characters
(\f(CW"0".."9"\fR, \f(CW"a".."f"\fR, \f(CW"A".."F"\fR).
.PP
With \f(CW"exact"\fR matching, each hash character matches a single literal hash
character. With \f(CW"digits"\fR and \f(CW"hexdigits"\fR matching, a single hash
character matches either a single literal hash character or a string of one
or more matched digit characters (i.e. decimal or hexadecimal digits,
respectively), and any string of two or more hash characters matches that
exact same number of literal hash characters or matched digit characters
(each character can either be a hash character or a digit character).
.PP
The syntax of the \fImatch\fR directive is:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  MATCH ::= "match" " "+ METHOD
\&  METHOD ::= "exact" | "digits" | "hexdigits"
.Ve
.PP
Examples:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  match exact
\&  match digits
\&  match hexdigits
.Ve
.SS "Syslog"
.IX Subsection "Syslog"
The \fIsyslog\fR directive specifies which \fI\f(BIsyslog\fI\|(3)\fR facility to use for log
messages. It consists of the word \f(CW"syslog"\fR followed by whitespace and one
of the following \fIsyslog\fR facility names: \f(CW"auth"\fR, \f(CW"user"\fR,
\&\f(CW"daemon"\fR, \f(CW"local0"\fR, \f(CW"local1"\fR, \f(CW"local2"\fR, \f(CW"local3"\fR,
\&\f(CW"local4"\fR, \f(CW"local5"\fR, \f(CW"local6"\fR or \f(CW"local7"\fR. The default value is
\&\f(CW"auth"\fR. Note that the \fIsyslog\fR directive may only appear in
\&\f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers\*(C'\fR, not in \f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers.d/*\*(C'\fR. Also, there should only be
one \fIsyslog\fR directive. If there is more than one, the last one takes
effect.
.PP
The syntax of the \fIsyslog\fR directive is:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  SYSLOG ::= "syslog" " "+ FACILITY
\&  FACILITY ::= "auth" | "user" | "daemon" | "local0" | "local1" |
\&      "local2" | "local3" | "local4" | "local5" | "local6" | "local7"
.Ve
.PP
Examples:
.PP
.Vb 11
\&  syslog auth
\&  syslog user
\&  syslog daemon
\&  syslog local0
\&  syslog local1
\&  syslog local2
\&  syslog local3
\&  syslog local4
\&  syslog local5
\&  syslog local6
\&  syslog local7
.Ve
.PP
Note: Syntax errors in the configuration files are logged. The \fIsyslog\fR
directive should appear near the top of the configuration file so that it
takes effect before any syntax errors are likely to be encountered. But if
\&\fIsshdo\fR's \f(CW\*(C`\-\-check\*(C'\fR option is always used to perform a syntax check
whenever the configuration changes, this isn't important.
.PP
Note: If the \fIsyslog\fR directive is used, then you will almost certainly
have to use a \fIlogfiles\fR directive (see the next section), or specify the
corresponding log files on the command line, when invoking \fIsshdo\fR with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-learn\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-unlearn\*(C'\fR option.
.SS "Logfiles"
.IX Subsection "Logfiles"
\&\fILogfiles\fR directives specify the file glob pattern(s) for locating the log
files that contain \fIsshdo\fR log messages. These log files will be the
default log file locations for \fIsshdo\fR's \f(CW\*(C`\-\-learn\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-\-unlearn\*(C'\fR
options. \fILogfiles\fR directives consist of the word \f(CW"logfiles"\fR followed
by one or more file glob patterns, all separated by whitespace. The default
is \f(CW\*(C`/var/log/auth.log*\*(C'\fR. Log files can be uncompressed or
\&\fI\f(BIgzip\fI\|(1)\fR\-compressed. The \fIlogfiles\fR argument can also be the dash
character (\f(CW"\-"\fR) which causes \fIsshdo\fR to read log messages from standard
input (\f(CW\*(C`stdin\*(C'\fR) by default (although that probably isn't very useful). Note
that \fIlogfiles\fR directives may only appear in \f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers\*(C'\fR, not in
\&\f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers.d/*\*(C'\fR. There can be multiple \fIlogfiles\fR directives and they
will all be used.
.PP
Examples:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  logfiles /var/log/auth.log*
\&  logfiles /var/log/auth.log* /var/log/syslog*
\&  logfiles /var/log/auth.log /var/log/auth.log.1 /var/log/auth.log.?.gz
.Ve
.SS "Banner"
.IX Subsection "Banner"
The \fIbanner\fR directive specifies the path of a file whose contents are to
be output to standard error (\f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR) for \fIssh\fR clients whose commands
are disallowed and not executed. It consists of the word \f(CW"banner"\fR
followed by whitespace and a file path. This can be used to inform clients
that their command failed due to \fIsshdo\fR's configuration rather than just
silently refusing to execute the command. Note that the \fIbanner\fR directive
may only appear in \f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers\*(C'\fR, not in \f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers.d/*\*(C'\fR. Also,
there should only be one \fIbanner\fR directive. If there is more than one, the
last one takes effect.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  banner /etc/sshdo.banner
.Ve
.PP
The default banner file contains the message:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  Access denied by sshdo policy.

But note that the default banner file is not used unless the \fIbanner\fR
directive is uncommented.

It might be a good idea to only use \f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers\*(C'\fR for the configuration
directives that can only appear in that file (i.e. \fIsyslog\fR, \fIlogfiles\fR,
\&\fIbanner\fR, \fImatch\fR and global \fItraining\fR directives) and any selective
\&\fItraining\fR directives, and to use files in \f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers.d/\*(C'\fR for
\&\fIauthorization\fR directives that allow users to execute commands.
.PP
If all \fIauthorization\fR directives are the result of \fIsshdo\fR's \f(CW\*(C`\-\-learn\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`\-\-unlearn\*(C'\fR options, this would mean that the manual configuration is
placed in \f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers\*(C'\fR and the semi-automatic configuration is kept
separate in one or more files in \f(CW\*(C`/etc/sshdoers.d/\*(C'\fR.
.PP
After training mode has been in place to gather new or existing
functionality that needs to be allowed, the corresponding new
\&\fIauthorization\fR directives can be added to the configuration with something
like:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  # sshdo \-\-learn > /etc/sshdoers.d/.learned
\&  # vim /etc/sshdoers.d/.learned # Verify that it is correct
\&  # sshdo \-\-check /etc/sshdoers.d/.learned
\&  /etc/sshdoers.d/.learned syntax OK
\&  # cat /etc/sshdoers.d/.learned >> /etc/sshdoers.d/learned
\&  # rm /etc/sshdoers.d/.learned
.Ve
.PP
Occasionally, any \fIauthorization\fR directives that are no longer in use can
be removed from the configuration with something like:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  # sshdo \-\-unlearn \-\-accepting > /etc/sshdoers.d/.learned
\&  # vim /etc/sshdoers.d/.learned # Verify that it is correct
\&  # sshdo \-\-check /etc/sshdoers.d/.learned
\&  /etc/sshdoers.d/.learned syntax OK
\&  # mv /etc/sshdoers.d/.learned /etc/sshdoers.d/learned
.Ve

If there are any errors in the configuration files, \fIsshdo\fR will ignore
them and carry on. This is to avoid being too brittle. But of course, it
would still be a problem. If any user names or group names were mistyped,
for example, then some commands that should be allowed would be disallowed.
A complete failure to read the configuration files would mean that all
commands would be disallowed. To avoid these problems, always make changes
to a copy of the configuration and then use \fIsshdo\fR's \f(CW\*(C`\-\-check\*(C'\fR option to
check the syntax of the copy before installing it as the new configuration.
And test the new configuration after installing it.
.PP
Also make sure that the users with \f(CW\*(C`~/.ssh/authorized_keys\*(C'\fR files that use
\&\fIsshdo\fR have permission to read the configuration files. If you don't want
the configuration files to be world-readable, add the affected users to a
new group (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`sshdoers\*(C'\fR) and make the configuration files readable by
that group, and make sure that \fIsshdo\fR log messages are only written to log
files that are not world-readable because any configuration directives that
contain a syntax error will be logged. Be aware that log messages might be
written to multiple log files. Check the configuration of your
\&\fI\f(BIsyslogd\fI\|(8)\fR\-compatible logging service for details. But if \fIsshdo\fR's
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-check\*(C'\fR option is always used to perform a syntax check whenever the
configuration changes, this isn't important.
